  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - asset/images/
     - asset/images/bottom_nav_icons/img_2.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Roboto
       fonts:
         - asset: asset/fonts/Roboto-VariableFont_wdth,wght.ttf
           style: normal
           weight: 400
     - family: Inter
       fonts:
         - asset: asset/fonts/Inter-VariableFont_opsz,wght.ttf
           style: normal
           weight: 400
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/to/font-from-package
